openzcore
=========

This, as I understand, is a Verilog implementation of a PowerPC instruction compatible set "soft core", for use in FPGA or ASIC chip design,
provided in open-source form under the GPL Version 2 license. (No "or later version" is listed, so it is Version 2 only.)

This source code is imported from the _Pippo-0.9.zip archive

It sounds like Pippo was the name of their prototyping board

uart_tools.exe is a rename of a [gibberish].exe file at the yahoo group download page. Beware of an exe from who knows where... Note that this exe file was provided outside and beside the _Pippo-0.9.zip file, and no source code was provided for this piece.
