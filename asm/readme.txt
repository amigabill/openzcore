1) Tests and toolchain files
    asm_test.S          powerpc test template file
    processor.h		    powerpc processor resouce definition
    asm_test.h		    test head definition
    ld.script		    loader scripts
    Makefile		    
2) Files generated by toolchain
    test.s		        
    asm_test.o
    go.elf
    go.bin              used by uart for run-time ucom burn, the file size should be equal ucom memory size
    go.srec             s-record file, use perl script to transfer to data file initialized as RTL's memory content
    go.dump             
3) s-record to hdl.memory transfer scripts
    perl.bat		    batch script on Windows platform, you should modify perl path here
    srec2hdlmem.pl      not use
    srec2hdlmemnew.pl   perl script to transfer s-record file to data file
    boot_binary.dat     data file - RTL memory initializing content, used by synthesis tool

We recommand to use codesourcery's GNU toolchains for PowerPC
